### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Leonardo, I'm a programmer and Mechanical Engineer. Ultimately, I've been working on different projects to expand my knowledge in Web Programming, such as my last project, which is basically a web app to track and analyse Stock portfolios. If you wish, you can check out my repositories to find other projects as well.
